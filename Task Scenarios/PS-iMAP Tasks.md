## **Tasks \- Pathologist**

To provide you with a clear context of the tasks you should perform, we will guide you through a scenario. In the following, you should execute the tasks according to the presented scenario.

### **Part 1 \- Free Exploration**

*Marcos is 37 years old, a pathologist, and in his free time, he enjoys cycling and creating medical illustrations related to nephropathology, which he posts on Instagram. Recently, Marcos started collaborating with Ana, a researcher in Computer Science, to apply Machine Learning techniques to images of lesions in kidney biopsies to aid in the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Ana recently recommended an online tool called PS-iMAP to him for visualizing lesions and the most commonly used Computational Pathology techniques.*

Please, execute the following tasks as if you were Marcos.

1. Login in the system with the following credentials (credentials omitted)  
2. Explore the tool freely and report your findings (Is there something surprising or particularly interesting?)

### **Part 2 \- Interacting with the data visualization**

*Ana, always interested in discussing lesion classifications, asks Marcos to use PS-iMAP so they can reach a consensus on which techniques to use for classifying some kidney lesions. Marcos, who enjoyed his initial experience with the tool, tries to use it.*

Please, execute the following tasks as if you were Marcos.

1. Locate the lesion "HYPERCELLULARITY, ENDOCAPILLARY"  
2. Find all the diseases connected to the lesion "HYPERCELLULARITY, ENDOCAPILLARY"  
3. Select the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL"  
4. Explore the network with the focus mode toggled on  
5. List the diseases connected to the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL"  
6. Find the lesions with the greatest number of diseases  
7. Locate and find out the characteristics of the disease "IGA NEPHROPATHY"

### **Part 3 \- Interacting with other PS-iMAP's resources**

*Marcos finds the tool that Ana presented interesting, but after identifying the diseases related to the lesion, he interacts with other resources available on PS-iMAP that will assist him in his research.*

Please, execute the following tasks as if you were Marcos.

8. Locate the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL"  
9. Find out how many images are associated with the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL"  
10. Identify how many related works to the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL" were found and how many of them are open access.  
11. What are the pathologists' activities that were automatized in the first three returned works related to the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL?" 

## **Tasks \- Computer Scientist**

To provide you with a clear context of the tasks you should perform, we will guide you through a scenario. In the following, you should execute the tasks according to the presented scenario.

### **Part 1 \- Free Exploration**

*Ana is 33 years old, has recently earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science, and in her free time, she enjoys listening to podcasts and participating in the Stack Overflow community by answering unresolved questions about Machine Learning. Recently, Ana started collaborating with Marcos, a pathologist interested in applying Machine Learning techniques to images of lesions in kidney biopsies to aid in the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Marcos recently recommended an online tool called PS-iMAP to her for visualizing lesions and the most commonly used Computational Pathology techniques.*

10. Identify how many related works to the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL" were found and how many of them are open access.  
11. What are the main computational techniques used in the first three returned works related to the lesion "SCLEROSIS, SEGMENTAL?"
